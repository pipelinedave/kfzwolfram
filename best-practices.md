# KFZ Wolfram Project Best Practices

## 1. **Code Quality**
- **Clean Code**: Ensure that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if used) are clean and well-organized. Each section of code should have a clear purpose and should follow conventions that make it easy to read and understand.
- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.) for better structure, accessibility, and SEO.
- **CSS Best Practices**:
  - Use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for layout management to ensure responsive design.
  - Use **variables** for colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure consistency across the page.
  - Maintain separation of concerns: Styles should only handle layout and presentation.
  - Avoid inline styles; keep them in the external `style.css` file.

## 2. **SEO Best Practices**
- **Meta Tags**: Include a unique title and description for each page. Use `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image` for social media sharing optimization.
- **Structured Data**: Add **schema.org** structured data to the page for better search engine visibility. Use JSON-LD format for markup.
- **Alt Text**: Provide descriptive and meaningful alt text for all images.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the website is fully mobile-responsive. Use viewport meta tag and ensure text is readable on all screen sizes.

## 3. **Accessibility Best Practices**
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements (buttons, links, etc.) are accessible via keyboard.
- **Color Contrast**: Maintain high contrast between text and background colors to ensure readability by users with visual impairments.
- **Aria Roles**: Use ARIA attributes to describe UI elements to assistive technologies.
- **Text Alternatives**: All images must have meaningful `alt` attributes to describe them for screen readers.

## 4. **Version Control**
- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages following the conventional commit format.
  - Example: `feat: add Google Maps integration`
  - Example: `fix: update car listing feed integration`
- **Branching Strategy**: Use feature branches for new functionality. Merge feature branches into `main` after reviewing and testing.
- **GitHub Actions**: Ensure continuous deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## 5. **Design Guidelines**
- **Consistency**: Use Material You design principles throughout the page. Ensure that typography, color schemes, and button styles are consistent.
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile first and progressively enhance the design for larger screens.
- **Load Time**: Optimize all images and assets for fast loading. Avoid large image sizes and unnecessary dependencies.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep dependencies to a minimum to reduce complexity and increase maintainability.

## 6. **Testing**
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure that the website works seamlessly across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Mobile Testing**: Test on various mobile devices to ensure the page is responsive and loads correctly.
- **Validation**: Use HTML and CSS validators to check for errors or issues in the markup and stylesheets.

## 7. **Deployment & Hosting**
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy the site using GitHub Pages. Use CI/CD pipelines to automatically deploy updates.
- **Documentation**: Keep documentation up to date, especially the README file. Include setup instructions, an overview of the project, and any configuration details.
